Hi there, I am Jiayi Nie, I am an automotive engineer with 15 years of R&D experience, and I am also a beginner in software development in Canada. After as an automotive engineer for 15 years, I think life should offer more possibilities. That’s why I decided to start fresh and pursue a new path. I’ve moved to Canada to begin my journey in software development.

I’m excited to learn, grow, and meet new people in this new chapter of my life. Besides work and studies, I love traveling, photography, and making new friends. If you’d like to know more about me, feel free to reach out!
